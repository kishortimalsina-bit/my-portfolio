  I am Kishor Timalsina from Kathmandu, Nepal. I am currently pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering from IOE Thapathali Campus. I've always been passionate about machines and curious about how they work. Since childhood, I have been fascinated by the way different mechanical systems operate and interact seamlessly. This curiosity motivated me to explore various fields within engineering and develop a deeper understanding of mechanics and design principles. Throughout my academic journey, I have dedicated myself to learning not only the theoretical aspects but also practical skills that are essential for solving real-world engineering problems. My enthusiasm for innovation and continuous learning pushes me to stay updated with the latest technological advancements in mechanical engineering and renewable energy. I am confident that my passion, combined with my education and hands-on experiences, will help me contribute meaningfully to the engineering community.

      One of my teachers in school told me, “It’s all science,” and from then on, my curiosity grew. After completing school, I passed the IOE entrance exam and began my engineering journey. At university, I’ve actively participated in programs and won competitions.

      Nepal, rich in water resources, is currently suffering due to a lack of skilled manpower and engineers. I believe if Nepal focuses on this field, we can become a renewable energy hub. As the world transitions from conventional to renewable energy in the 21st century, we can utilize our resources in industries and even export excess power.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently researching hydropower, turbine design, and reducing economic burdens by optimizing components. An engineer’s role is to design systems that are economical, simple, and efficient. I aim to pursue a Master’s in Renewable Energy and dedicate my career to this cause.
